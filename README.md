# Foundation libc

A C standard library that only implements a subset of functions that can be safely used without an operating system.
This is called a [freestanding environment](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding).

This libc is primarily meant to be used with microcontrollers, hobbyist operating systems and so on.

## Support

The first goal is to reach full C11 *freestanding* support.

- No support for locales
- No allocator (ship your own!)
- No support for functions that require an operating system of sorts in the background.
- No support for `wchar_t` and `wchar.h` as it isn't portable between compilers.

## Development

Zig Version: 0.11


Run
```sh-session
user@microzig ~/foundation-libc $ zig build
user@microzig ~/foundation-libc $ 
```

to compile the libc and generate a lib file in `zig-out/lib` as well as the headers in `zig-out/include`.

## Contribution

Start by grabbing a header marked with ⏳ or 🛠 and implement the functions from that header. See if others already have a PR open for those functions so you don't do work twice!

Leverage functions from Zig `std` if possible as they are already well tested and should work.

Which functions belong into which header can be figured out by taking a look at the *C11 Standard Draft* document or the *IBM libc functions* list. [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c) usually has the better docs though, so best check out both.
